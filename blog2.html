                <p>Books have the power to transport us to different worlds, evoke strong emotions, and shape our perspectives. Among the countless books we've read, there are a few that hold a special place in our hearts. For us, those books are Urdu novels like Jannat Ke Patty and Namal.                </p>
                <p>
                    Jannat Ke Patty, written by Nimra Ahmed, is a tale of love, loss, and redemption. The story follows the protagonist, Aliya, as she navigates the complexities of life and relationships. What resonates with us is the author's masterful exploration of human emotions, making us reflect on our own experiences and connections.
                </p>    
                Namal, penned by Nimra Ahmed, is a thought-provoking novel that delves into the themes of identity, faith, and personal growth. The narrative follows the journey of a young woman, Zaria, as she grapples with her beliefs and sense of belonging. We admire how the author skillfully weaves together philosophical and spiritual concepts, encouraging us to question and seek our own truths.
                <p>   
                    These Urdu novels matter to us because they:
